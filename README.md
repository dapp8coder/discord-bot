Discord Bot for steem-apps

Dev setup:

Requires you to set up a config.ts in the src folder with your Discord Bot User's token.<br>
`npm i`<br>
`npm start`

Discord command:

`$top` or `!top`

Parameters:

Sort by: `rewards_steem`, `rewards_sbd`, `volume_steem`, `volume_sbd`, `tx`, `dau`

Order: `asc`, `desc`

Time Period: `last_day`, `last_week`, `last_month`

Default is last_month by the ranking from steem apps, the only way to get the ranking in order is not passing a sort by parameter. Parameter order does not matter.

More sort parameters will be passed once the API is updated to include app types (e.g. dapps, apps, interfaces) and categories.
